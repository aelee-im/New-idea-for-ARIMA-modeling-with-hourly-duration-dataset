# New idea for seasonal ARIMA modeling with hourly duration dataset
### - One suggestion of new idea to solve the problem with hourly duration dataset
### - To overcome the difficulties of multi-seasonality of time series dataset
### - with extended forecasting time period (24hrs ahead -> 48hrs ahead)
### * Solution : Temporally remove seasonality during model building and restore dataset in the end (That is, ARIMA modeling without seasonality but getting final model with seasonality.)
